    """The code asks the user what number they want to stop at when defineing prime numbers.
First it takes a number to see if it is divisible by more than two numbers
and if it is, it's not a prime number. If it is divisible by only two 
numbers it is a prime number, and it tells that to the user. It also tells 
the user what isn't a prime number and why (by that I mean what is the third number it is divisible by).

The errors: 
The code only initialize c (count) once to 0.
There is no way the code can tell the user that a 
number is a prime number since there is no break statement and c keeps going up and 
never stoping ever (or until it iterates through all the numbers)."""
