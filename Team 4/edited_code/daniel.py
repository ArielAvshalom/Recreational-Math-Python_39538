'''
The Pancake Flipping Problem: 
The goal is to get the largest number in the array at the end (bottom) using reversals only
Unsorted: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] -->  Sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
The simplest pancake sorting algorithm uses at most 2n -3 flips. 
Similar to selection sort we bring the largest number to the top of the array with one flip.
Then we take it to the end of the array with another flip.
We continue to do this until the array is sorted.

# The goal is to get the largest number in the array at the end (bottom)
# so 1 2 3 4 5
# using reversal only
# The simplest pancake sorting algorithm performs at most 2n âˆ’ 3 flips. In this algorithm, a kind of selection sort,
# we bring the largest pancake not yet sorted to the top with one flip; take it down to its final position with one more flip; and repeat this process for the remaining pancakes.
