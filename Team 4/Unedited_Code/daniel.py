# pancake flipping problem
# The goal is to get the largest number in the array at the end (bottom)
# so 1 2 3 4 5
# using reversal only
# The simplest pancake sorting algorithm performs at most 2n âˆ’ 3 flips. In this algorithm, a kind of selection sort,
# we bring the largest pancake not yet sorted to the top with one flip; take it down to its final position with one more flip; and repeat this process for the remaining pancakes.

BUG HERE: Need to pass the size of the array in the function. We need to call reverse function multiple times with a decreasing array size.
If we dont pass the size it becomes extremely difficult to monitor the size of the unsorted segment of the array.

We also added a function that creates an array and sorts using the other function for a clearer respresentation of what we are doing.
