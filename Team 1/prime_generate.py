    Generating Primes using the sieve of sieve of eratosthenes
    -A prime is defined as an number that is divisible by one and itself

    Description: We begin with a list of natural numbers. We start with 2 and assume it to be prime and 
    filter all multiples of two from our list. That will give us a new list of natural numbers. Then we move
    to our next number in our new list which is three. We then filter from our new list all multiples of three
    to generate our new list. If we keep on repeating this procedure, we will eventually be left with a list
    of all prime numbers. 
    
    IMPLICIT ERRORS:
    1. appending two initally the factor arrays prevents it from being returned when the prime generator is called
    and thus two is not returned as a prime

    2. input is not checked for numeric values so when the input is not numeric and is converted to the int data type using the 
    int() function, the program crashes

    ### Returns
    - generator
        - return a generator that finds the next prime number
